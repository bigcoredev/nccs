## NTEE Version 2.0 Code Structure

The NTEE code conventions below reflect the new format: NTEE Version 2.0 (NTEEV2). The codes are structured in three parts:

1.  Level 1: Industry Group
2.  Level 2-4: Major Group, Division and Subdivision
3.  Level 5: Organization Type

This 3-part "tidy" format adds the higher-level industry code for interpretability and makes the organizational type an explicit level. 

![](img/nteev2-structure.png)


*Levels 2-4 are identical to the original NTEE code structure EXCEPT that the "common code" types represented by x01, x02, x03, x05, x11, x12, and x19 have been converted to distinct organizational codes (see Level 5 Organization Type Codes below). The common code digits have been replaced with x00 for all specialized organizations that operate at the Major Group level. If a specialized organization operates within a Division or Subdivision they have been assigned the appropriate 2-digit codes. [See the documentation for more details](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/mission-taxonomies/blob/main/NTEEV2/README.md).*

### Example 

```
Old:   B29            (charter school)
New:   EDU-B29-RG     (RG = "regular" or non-specialized nonprofit)

Old:   B01            (advocacy broadly for the education sector)
New:   EDU-B00-AA     (AA = advocacy organization) 

Old:   B0129          (advocacy specifically for charter schools)
New:   EDU-B29-AA
```

ind %>% knitr::kable( format="simple" )
```

<br>

### Level 2 Major Group Categories:

### Level 3 and Level 4 Categories

There are approximately 650 Level 3 (Division) and Level 4 (Subdivision) NTEE categories. They are represented succinctly in the following two-page table: 

[Level 3-4 Category Labels](https://nccs.urban.org/nccs/pubs/ntee-two-page-2005.pdf)

<br>


### Level 5 Organization Type Codes:

In the new system, code levels 2-4 are the same as the original NTEE system except organizational type has been changed from a LEV34 code designation (x01-x19) to an independent feature (the LEV5 column).

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false

org.type <- 
tribble(
 ~`Level 5`, ~`Level 5 Label (ORGANIZATION TYPE)`,
 "Major Group",  "Level 2 NTEE Major Group Designation",
 "RG",  "Regular Nonprofit",  
 "AA",  "Alliance/Advocacy Organizations (*formerly 01*)", 
 "MT",  "Management and Technical Assistance (*formerly 02*)", 
 "PA",  "Professional Societies/Associations (*formerly 03*)", 
 "RP",  "Research Institutes and/or Public Policy Analysis (*formerly 05*)", 
 "MS",  "Monetary Support - Single Organization (*formerly 11*)", 
 "MM",  "Monetary Support - Multiple Organizations (*formerly 12*)", 
 "NS",  "Nonmonetary Support Not Elsewhere Classified (N.E.C.) (*formerly 19*)"
)
