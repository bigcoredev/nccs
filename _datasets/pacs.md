## Political Nonprofits

Nonprofits with 527 status are [primarily established](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/political-organizations) to “influence the selection, nomination, election, appointment or defeat of candidates to federal, state or local public office.”  In the post–Citizen's United era, where powerful interest groups are seeking new ways to assert political influence, data related to these political nonprofits have become more important than ever.

Political action committees often emerge when nonprofits, typically incorporated with 501(c)(4) status (as opposed to 501(c)(3) charities), apply for 527 status. This application process is documented in forms such as [completing Form 8871](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/political-organizations/political-organization-filing-and-disclosure). **POL-ORGS-FM-8871** and **POL-ORGS-SCHED-D**, **POL-ORGS-SCHED-E**, and **POL-ORGS-SCHED-R** all contain metadata and disclosures from the application process. These documents are static files describing the characteristics of these organizations.

Once recognized, these political nonprofits are required to continue filing IRS 990 forms, similar to typical nonprofits. But they are also required to submit [Form 8872 disclosures](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/political-organizations/political-organization-filing-and-disclosure) which are described in tables like **POL-ORGS-FM-8872**, **POL-ORGS-SCHED-A**, and **POL-ORGS-SCHED-B**. 

The IRS regularly releases data on PAC activities,  as documented in Forms 8871 and 8872. Unfortunately, the [data are released in complicated ASCII formats](https://forms.irs.gov/app/pod/dataDownload/dataDownload). These files can be challenging to work with because of mixed data types within rows and occasionally data irregularities that break the ASCII structure. To make these data available to the sector, Jesse Lecy has developed a parser to transform these raw files into well-structured tables.
