## Overview

Most tax-exempt organizations other than churches and certain church-related organizations are required to file an annual information return or notice with the IRS.

Organizations that do not file for three consecutive years automatically lose their tax-exempt status. An automatic revocation is effective on the original filing due date of the third annual return or notice. (Section 6033(j) of the Internal Revenue Code).
