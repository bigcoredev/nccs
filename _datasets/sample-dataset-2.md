The IRS 990 Business Master File, often referred to as the "BMF," is a database maintained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States. It contains information about tax-exempt organizations and other entities that are required to file various forms of the IRS Form 990 series. These organizations include:

Nonprofit organizations: Such as charitable organizations, foundations, religious organizations, and other tax-exempt entities under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Social clubs: Organizations that meet the criteria for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Business leagues and associations: Such as chambers of commerce, trade associations, and other organizations eligible for tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(6).

Political organizations: Entities that are tax-exempt under section 527, which includes political action committees (PACs).

The IRS 990 Business Master File contains key information about these organizations, including their legal names, addresses, EINs (Employer Identification Numbers), filing statuses, and the forms they have filed. This database helps the IRS and the public track and monitor the activities of tax-exempt organizations and ensures that they comply with the tax laws and regulations applicable to their specific tax-exempt status.

Researchers, government agencies, journalists, and the general public often use the IRS 990 Business Master File to access information about nonprofit organizations, assess their financial health, and evaluate their compliance with tax regulations. The data in this file can provide valuable insights into the operations and finances of these entities. It's worth noting that while certain information from Form 990 filings is publicly available and can be accessed through the IRS website or other sources, sensitive information like donor names and addresses is typically redacted to protect privacy.
