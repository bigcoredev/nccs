abstract: "The Regulation of Nonprofits and Philanthropy Project is an initiative of Urban Instituteâ€™s Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy. Organized in conjunction with the Tax Policy and Charities Project at the Urban Institute, the project will focus on empirical research that addresses the current status of the regulatory system and the effects of regulations on nonprofit organizations and philanthropy. Using a mix of research methodologies and data sources, the project fills gaps in knowledge and host discussions that will begin to address the strengths and weaknesses of the current regulatory framework and make recommendations to promote a regulatory framework that is elastic enough to encompass the significant changes taking place in the nonprofit and philanthropic sector."
