## Our Mission 

The National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) is a distinguished research and data resource institution dedicated to advancing the knowledge and understanding of the nonprofit and charitable sector that operates at the intersection of data, research, and philanthropy. 

Established as part of the Center for Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, NCCS plays a pivotal role in providing comprehensive and meticulously curated data, timely research, and empirical analysis pertaining to charitable and nonprofit organizations operating across diverse fields and missions. 

We strive for excellence in the following areas: 

* **Data Accessibility:**  NCCS exemplifies a commitment to transparency and public access by making all data and research findings free to scholars, policymakers, philanthropists, nonprofit practitioners, and the broader public. This commitment fosters informed decision-making, fosters accountability, and facilitates a better understanding of nonprofit activities.
* **Impactful Insights:**  By providing a rich tapestry of historical and contemporary data, we empower stakeholders to gain valuable insights into nonprofit financial health, governance structures, programmatic endeavors, and overall sector trends. These insights play a vital role in shaping public policy, philanthropic strategies, and the practices of nonprofit organizations.
* **Data Quality:** We serve as the foremost authority for the collection, organization, and dissemination of critical data related to nonprofit entities. We use Urban's robust data infrastructure and collaboration with regulatory agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Nonprofit Open Data Collective to provide high-quality financial, operational, and governance information on a wide spectrum of nonprofits.
* **Research Excellence:** We are committed to fostering evidence-based research and supporting a wide array of research initiatives aimed at shedding light on the nonprofit sector dynamics, challenges, and impact. Through our research we endeavor to deepen our understanding of the role nonprofits play in addressing pressing community, economic, and civil society challenges.
* **Resource Hub:** Beyond providing data, NCCS serves as a central hub for information, resources, and tools designed to support nonprofit organizations in their operations, compliance, and reporting requirements. It fosters capacity-building within the sector by offering expertise, guidance and assistance.
* **Building a Collaborative Network:** We actively engages with a diverse network of partners that includes academics, think tanks, government agencies, foundations, and nonprofit organizations. Collaboration is fundamental to our mission if we are to remain responsive to the evolving needs of the sector.

We remain dedication to providing accurate, comprehensive, and accessible information that empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and advances the collective understanding of the nonprofit sector's vital contributions to society.
