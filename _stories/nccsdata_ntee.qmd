## Introduction

In part 2 of this 4-part series on the [`nccsdata`](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/nccsdata/) package, we cover how to explore and query NTEE codes with the help of [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) and [`parse_ntee()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/parse_ntee.html).

## NTEE Code Structure

The NTEE2 code system is a new code system that builds on the original National
Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) code system used by the IRS and NCCS to
classify nonprofit organizations. A comprehensive overview of NTEE codes
is available at [this link](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/mission-taxonomies/blob/main/NTEE-disaggregated/README.md#ntee2-format).

This new NTEE system can be split into 5 levels.

![](nccsdata/ntee2-structure.png)

These are grouped into 3 parts:

1. Level 1: Industry Group
2. Level 2-4: Industry, Division and Subdivision
3. Level 5: Organization Type

Each part is separated by a hyphen and all NTEE2 codes must contain all
3 parts(or 5 Levels) in sequence.

### Level 1: Industry Groups

The Industry Group is represented by three letters. The 10 options are:

| Industry Group |	Description |
|:------------------:|:-------------:|
| ART	| Arts, Culture & Humanities |
| EDU	| Education |
| ENV | Environment and Animals |
| HEL | Health |
| HMS | Human Services |
| IFA | International, Foreign Affairs |
| PSB | Public, Societal Benefit |
| REL | Religion Related |
| MMB | Mutual/Membership Benefit |
| UNU | Unknown, Unclassified |
| UNI | University |
| HOS | Hospital |

Each group represents a broad category that the universe of non-profits can be comprehensively sorted into.

### Level 2: Industry

The industry is represented as one letter. The 26 options are: 

| Industry Label |	Description|
|:------------------:|:-------------:|
|A	| Arts, Culture & Humanities |
|B	| Education |
|C	| Environment |
|D	| Animal-Related |
|E	| Health Care |
|F	| Mental Health & Crisis Intervention |
|G	| Voluntary Health Associations & Medical Disciplines |
|H	| Medical Research |
|I	| Crime & Legal-Related |
|J	| Employment |
|K	| Food, Agriculture & Nutrition |
|L	| Housing & Shelter |
|M	| Public Safety, Disaster Preparedness & Relief |
|N	| Recreation & Sports |
|O	| Youth Development |
|P	| Human Services |
|Q	| International, Foreign Affairs & National Security |
|R	| Civil Rights, Social Action & Advocacy |
|S	| Community Improvement & Capacity Building |
|T	| Philanthropy, Voluntarism & Grantmaking Foundations |
|U	| Science & Technology |
|V	| Social Science |
|W	| Public & Societal Benefit |
|X	| Religion-Related |
|Y	| Mutual & Membership Benefit |
|Z	| Unknown |

These offer a finer sub classification that builds on the Industry Group classification framework.

### Level 3 and 4: Division and Subdivision

Levels 3 and 4 are alphanumeric values that reference additional subclassifications for the Industry Group - Industry Combinations above. There are too many for a simple table and hence will be explored with [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) in the below sections.

### Level 5: Organization Type

Level 5 references the type of organization represented by two letters. The options are:

| Organization Type |	Description |
|:------------------:|:-------------:|
| RG	| Regular Nonprofit |
| AA	| Alliance/Advocacy Organizations |
| MT | Management and Technical Assistance |
| PA | Professional Societies/Associations |
| RP | Research Institutes and/or Public Policy Analysis |
| MS | Monetary Support - Single Organization |
| MM | Monetary Support - Multiple Organizations |
| NS | Nonmonetary Support Not Elsewhere Classified (N.E.C.) |

## Retrieving NTEE Code Descriptions with [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html)

[`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) provides descriptions for full codes when the *ntee* argument is provided any of the 5 levels above. A sample output is provided below:

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee = "UNI")
```

In the above code snippet, [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) prints out the descriptions of all NTEE codes belonging to the "UNI" (University) Industry Group. The function outputs are nested in the following order:

+ Industry Group (Level 1)
  + Organization Type (Level 5)
    + Industry, Division and Subdivision (Levels 2-4)
    
*ntee* takes arguments belonging to **any** of the 3 parts or 5 levels above and 
returns **all** matching NTEE codes. For example, the below code snippet returns all NTEE codes belonging to either the University Industry Group (UNI) or A25 Level 2-4 classification.

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee = c("UNI", "A25"))
```

You can also preview specific NTEE codes with the *ntee* argument as shown here:

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee = c("ART-A61-AA",
                      "ART-A54-MT"))
```

[`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) automatically structures the output to avoid repeating Industry Groups or Organization Types.

For Industry, Division and Subdivision (Level 2-4), [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) accepts placeholder arguments denoted by the letter *x* (case insensitive). For example, *ntee = B2x* will provide a preview for all NTEE codes with a *B* at Level 2 and *2* at Level 3. This allows the user to narrow their search to specific levels. Examples are provided below:

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee = "Uxx")
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee = "H3x")
```

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee = "B2x")
```

Once you are familiar with each level, you can leverage the following additional arguments from [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html):

* `ntee.group` : Industry Group (Level 1)
* `ntee.code` : Industry, Division and Subdivision (Level 2 - 4)
* `ntee.orgtype` : Organization Type (Level 5)

For *ntee.code*, placeholder arguments are supported as well.

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee_preview(ntee.group = "UNI",
             ntee.code = "Cxx")
```

For any combination of *ntee* arguments, *preview_ntee* returns **all** codes
that fit **any** of the arguments. Thus, in the above example NTEE codes for both
`UNI* and *CXX* were printed out.

## Returning to get_data()

The same set of *ntee* arguments used by *preview_ntee()* are also used by [`get_data()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/get_data.html). The below code snippet downloads core data from the year 2015 for all non-profits that file both full 990s and 990EZs, filtering for nonprofits belonging to the Education Industry Group.

```{r message = TRUE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
core <- get_data(dsname = "core",
                 time = "2015",
                 scope.orgtype = "NONPROFIT",
                 scope.formtype = "PZ",
                 ntee.group = "EDU")
```

## Retrieve Complete NTEE2 Codes

[`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) also offers an invisible return, allowing users to save the full NTEE2 codes that are being previewed in a character vector. Simply assign the output of [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) to a variable name.

```{r warning = FALSE}
ntee2_codes <- ntee_preview(ntee.group = "UNI",
                            ntee.code = "Cxx")
print(ntee2_codes)
```

## Alternative Methods to Retrieve Complete NTEE2 Codes

A second function, [`parse_ntee()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/parse_ntee.html), can also be used to extract complete NTEE codes.

[`parse_ntee()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/parse_ntee.html) only accepts the following arguments:

* `ntee.group`: Industry Group (Level 1)
* `ntee.code`: Industry, Division and Subdivision (Level 2 - 4)
* `ntee.orgtype`: Organization Type (Level 5)

Use *all* to include all Levels for that specific argument. For example, to
retrieve complete NTEE codes for Universities:

```{r warning = FALSE}
parse_ntee(ntee.group = c("UNI"),
           ntee.code = "all",
           ntee.orgtype = "all")
```

Similar to [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html), [`parse_ntee()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/parse_ntee.html) accepts placeholder arguments.

```{r warning = FALSE}
parse_ntee(ntee.group = "all",
           ntee.code = "A2x",
           ntee.orgtype = "all")
```


However, [`parse_ntee()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/parse_ntee.html) differs from [`ntee_preview()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/ntee_preview.html) in that it only returns NTEE codes that meet all filters

```{r warning = FALSE}
parse_ntee(ntee.group = "HEL",
           ntee.code = "A2x",
           ntee.orgtype = "all")
```

Since there are no NTEE codes with structure *HEL-A2X-XXX*, [`parse_ntee()`](file:///C:/Users/tpoongundranar/Documents/Urban/NCCS/nccsdata/docs/reference/parse_ntee.html) does not return any results. Including *"ART"* in *ntee.group*, as shown below, returns valid codes since there are NTEE codes with the *ART-A2X-XXX* structure.

```{r warning = FALSE}
parse_ntee(ntee.group = c("HEL", "ART"),
           ntee.code = "A2x",
           ntee.orgtype = "all")
```

*parse_ntee* can thus be used to find specific codes which can then be fed into *get_data* to filter downloaded data by specific codes as shown below:

```{r warning = FALSE}
ART_A2X_codes <- parse_ntee(ntee.group = c("HEL", "ART"),
                            ntee.code = "A2x",
                            ntee.orgtype = "all")

core_2015_arta2x <- get_data(dsname = "core",
                             time = "2015",
                             scope.orgtype = "NONPROFIT",
                             scope.formtype = "PZ",
                             ntee = ART_A2X_codes)
```

## Conclusion

Understanding NTEE codes is crucial to constructing data sets that target specific nonprofits. When leveraged correctly, the NTEE taxonomy is a useful and powerful framework to structure research projects involving NCCS data.
