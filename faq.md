## FOR NONPROFITS 

### How Do I Select An NTEE Code For My Organization?

Nonprofits are required to select an NTEE code when applying for tax
exempt status. A full list of codes and descriptions used by the IRS can
be found
[here](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/nccs-legacy/ntee/ntee.html), a
searchable table of those same codes can be found
[here](https://nccs.urban.org/nccs/widgets/ntee_tables/ntee1_table.html),
and a concise 2-page cheat sheet can be found
[here](https://nccs.urban.org/nccs/pubs/ntee-two-page-2005.pdf).

It is the IRS and not NCCS that maintains the official database of
codes. NCCS **cannot** change or assign NTEE codes for any organization.

### How Can I Obtain An NTEE Code Or Change My Current Code?

To modify or obtain an NTEE code, an organization should send a written
request to the IRS Correspondence Unit with the relevant facts,
including the Code currently assigned, if any, and the requested Code,
as well as who selected the currently assigned Code initially, if known.

The Correspondence Unit will refer to the IRS Exempt Organizations
Divisions, if necessary, and will notify the organization if a form or
user fee is required to make the requested change. The written request
must be sent or faxed to:

Internal Revenue Service  
Attn: Correspondence Unit  
P.O. Box 2508, Room 6403  
Cincinnati, Ohio 45201  
Fax: (855) 204-6184

Express and Overnight Delivery: <br> Internal Revenue Service <br> Attn:
Correspondence Unit <br> 500 Main Street, Room 6403 <br> Cincinnati,
Ohio 45202 <br>
